Usage:

zcat gt_chrXX.xml.gz | ./snp <treshold> > output.txt

The <treshold> is optional and specified in percentages.

The file gt_chrXX.xml.gz is one of the files in:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606/genotype/
The program is tested with these files, but in principle, any of the files in:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/*/genotype/
should work.

Make sure the libexpat1-dev library is installed (or any other library that
provides expat.h and expat.lib).
